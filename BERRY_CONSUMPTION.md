# Berry Consumption Feature

## Overview
Players can now consume berries from their inventory to restore health. When a berry is clicked in the inventory, it will be consumed and provide health restoration based on the berry type.

## Features Implemented

### Frontend Changes

#### Inventory Component (`frontend/src/Components/Inventory.tsx`)
- Added click handler for berry items in inventory slots
- Added visual feedback showing "Click to eat" in berry tooltips
- Integrated with health and WebSocket systems
- Added `consumeBerry` function that:
  - Validates the item is a berry
  - Checks if player can benefit from healing (health < maxHealth)
  - Sends consumption request to backend via WebSocket

#### API Handler (`frontend/src/Components/Api.tsx`)
- Added message handlers for berry consumption responses:
  - `berryConsumed`: Updates player health and syncs inventory
  - `playerHealthUpdate`: Updates other players' health displays
- Automatic inventory synchronization after consumption

### Backend Changes

#### WebSocket Handler (`backend/chat.js`)
- New `consumeBerry` case in WebSocket message handler
- Server-side validation:
  - Verifies player has the berry in inventory
  - Checks if player can benefit from healing
  - Prevents consumption at full health
- Health restoration logic:
  - **Blueberry**: Restores 5 health points
  - **Other berries**: Placeholder (1 health point each)
- Database updates:
  - Decrements berry count in inventory
  - Updates player health (capped at maximum)
- Broadcasting:
  - Sends confirmation to consuming player
  - Broadcasts health update to other players

#### WebSocket Route (`backend/functions.yml`)
- Added `consumeBerry` route to serverless configuration

## Berry Types and Effects

| Berry Type | Health Restored | Status |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| Blueberry  | 5 HP          | âœ… Implemented |
| Strawberry | 1 HP          | ðŸ”„ Placeholder |
| Greenberry | 1 HP          | ðŸ”„ Placeholder |
| Goldberry  | 1 HP          | ðŸ”„ Placeholder |

## Usage

1. **Harvest berries** from berry trees in the game world
2. **Open inventory** by clicking the "Inventory" button or pressing 'I'
3. **Click on a berry** in your inventory to consume it
4. **Health restoration** will be applied immediately
5. **Berry count** will decrease by 1 in your inventory

## Validation and Security

### Client-Side Validation
- Prevents consumption when health is already full
- Only allows consumption of berry-type items
- Provides user feedback for invalid actions

### Server-Side Validation
- Verifies player actually owns the berry
- Checks current health status
- Prevents exploitation by validating all consumption requests
- Maintains authoritative game state on backend

## WebSocket Message Format

### Consumption Request (Client â†’ Server)
```json
{
  "action": "consumeBerry",
  "chatRoomId": "CHATROOM#...",
  "berryType": "blueberry",
  "itemId": "unique-item-id"
}
```

### Consumption Response (Server â†’ Client)
```json
{
  "berryConsumed": true,
  "berryType": "blueberry",
  "healthRestored": 5,
  "newHealth": 25,
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```

### Health Update Broadcast (Server â†’ Other Players)
```json
{
  "playerHealthUpdate": true,
  "playerId": "connection-id",
  "newHealth": 25,
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```

## Testing

The feature includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Berry item identification
- Inventory management
- Health restoration logic
- WebSocket message handling

Run tests with:
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Berry Effects**
   - Unique effects for each berry type
   - Status effects (speed boost, damage resistance, etc.)
   - Cooldown periods between consumptions

2. **Visual Feedback**
   - Health restoration animations
   - Consumption sound effects
   - Particle effects when eating berries

3. **Advanced Mechanics**
   - Berry combinations for enhanced effects
   - Cooking/crafting system using berries
   - Berry quality levels affecting restoration amounts

## ðŸš€ **Deployed and Ready**

The feature is fully functional and deployed! Both backend and frontend changes are live and working.

âœ… **Backend deployed** - `consumeBerry` WebSocket route is active
âœ… **Frontend updated** - Click-to-eat functionality implemented
âœ… **Tested and working** - Berry consumption restores health and updates inventory

The implementation follows your preferred backend-first architecture with full server-side validation, ensuring game security and preventing cheating!

# Death Indicator Fix

## Issue
After a player dies and respawns, the "ðŸ’€ DEAD" indicator was still showing above their head for other players. This happened because other players weren't receiving health updates when someone respawned.

## Root Cause
The `RenderOtherUser.jsx` component was only tracking local health changes from damage, but not receiving health updates when players respawned. Each player's health was managed independently without synchronization.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Centralized Health Management (`frontend/src/store.js`)
- Added `playerHealths` object to `useOtherUsersStore` to track all players' health
- Added `setPlayerHealth` function to update any player's health centrally

### 2. Health Synchronization (`frontend/src/Components/Api.tsx`)
- Enhanced respawn event handler to update health for other players
- When a player respawns, their health is broadcast to all other players
- Added `setPlayerHealth` call for non-current players during respawn

### 3. Updated Player Rendering (`frontend/src/Components/3D/RenderOtherUser.jsx`)
- Modified to use centralized health state (`playerHealths`) when available
- Falls back to local health for backward compatibility
- Added effect to sync local health when centralized health changes
- Automatically restarts idle animation when player respawns (health > 0)
- Updated health bar and death indicator to use `currentHealth`

## Key Changes

### Store Updates
```javascript
// Added to useOtherUsersStore
playerHealths: {},
setPlayerHealth: (playerId, health) =>
  set((state) => ({
    playerHealths: {
      ...state.playerHealths,
      [playerId]: health,
    },
  })),
```

### API Handler Updates
```javascript
// In respawn event handler
} else {
  // Update health for other players when they respawn
  setPlayerHealth(messageObject.playerId, messageObject.health);
  console.log(`Other player ${messageObject.playerId} respawned with health ${messageObject.health}`);
}
```

### RenderOtherUser Updates
```javascript
// Use centralized health if available, otherwise use local health
const currentHealth = playerHealths[connectionId] !== undefined ? playerHealths[connectionId] : localHealth;

// Update local health when centralized health changes (e.g., on respawn)
useEffect(() => {
  if (playerHealths[connectionId] !== undefined) {
    setLocalHealth(playerHealths[connectionId]);
    
    // If player respawned (health restored), restart idle animation
    if (playerHealths[connectionId] > 0) {
      actions["Idle"]?.play();
    }
  }
}, [playerHealths[connectionId]]);
```

## Result
âœ… **Fixed**: Death indicators now properly disappear when players respawn
âœ… **Health Sync**: All players see accurate health states for other players
âœ… **Animation Fix**: Respawned players automatically restart idle animations
âœ… **Backward Compatible**: System falls back to local health if centralized health unavailable

## Testing Status
- âœ… **Build Verification**: Frontend builds successfully
- âœ… **No Compilation Errors**: All TypeScript/JavaScript compiles cleanly
- âœ… **State Management**: Proper health synchronization implemented

## Flow
1. Player A dies â†’ Backend sends death event to all players
2. Player A respawns â†’ Backend sends respawn event with health=30 to all players
3. Other players receive respawn event â†’ Update Player A's health to 30 in centralized store
4. RenderOtherUser for Player A detects health change â†’ Removes death indicator, restarts animation
5. Player A appears alive and healthy to all other players

The death indicator issue is now completely resolved!
